# Serie A Scores
Serie A Scores is an app that tracks the latest serie A results. It fetches the data from [Football-Data.org API](https://www.football-data.org/).

## Setup
Just clone the repo and get your API KEY by registering to the API [website](https://www.football-data.org/client/register).
Be careful that the free plan provides maximum 10 Api calls per minute.

Once you have your API KEY, write it as the value of API_KEY in the .env.example file and rename the file to .env.

## About
The idea for this app came to me in high school when we were told to create a simple app to test Flutter.<br>
I presented it to the teachers during my high school oral exam and I must say that they were enthusiastic about it ðŸ™‚
